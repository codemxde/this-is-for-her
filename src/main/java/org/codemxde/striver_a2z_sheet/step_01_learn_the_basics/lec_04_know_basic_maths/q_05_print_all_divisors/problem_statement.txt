You are given an integer n. You need to find all the divisors of n. Return all the divisors of n as an array or list in a sorted order.



A number which completely divides another number is called it's divisor.


Examples:
Input: n = 6

Output = [1, 2, 3, 6]

Explanation: The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.

Input: n = 8

Output: [1, 2, 4, 8]

Explanation: The divisors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, 8.

Input: n = 7

Output:
[1, 7]
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 1000
