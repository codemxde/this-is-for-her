## Plan
- Finish two-pointer basics + 3 problems.

## What I did
- Solved 3 problems; revised edge cases.

## Problems
| platform | id | title                | link                                      | diff | topics            | attempts | time_min | status | time_complexity | space_complexity |

## Notes
- Trick for container: move the shorter wall.
- Edge case handling for palindrome: ignore non-alphanum.
