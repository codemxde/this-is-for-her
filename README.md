# this is for her
you read this repository right, no typos, no misinformation <br/>
enough beating around the bush, enough with the random bursts of motivation <br/>
enough with the day-dreaming, enough with the hype insemination <br/>
enough is enough, this time it is for her reputation

## do you remember ?
do you remember the nights, do you remember the void when happiness comes, <br/>
do you remember the fights, do you remember your eyes when the doubts came ? <br/> <br/>

you get distracted from achieving what you're really made for, <br/>
you forget what you're really here for <br/>

## _what are you even really here for ?_
- become capable, reliable and sufficient for her
- become the best version of myself, and care for her
- get rich or die trying, burn the midnight oil to ashes for her

## enough poetry, how ?
- solve the a2z striver dsa sheet
- practice problems and give contests on leetcode, codechef
- master core computer science fundamentals (os, cn, dbms)
- Become an excellent software engineer and get placed in a top product based company
